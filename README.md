# Diffusion-Generative-Model-Playground

This repository contains simple from scratch implementations of Diffusion Generative Models for small toy examples that can easily be run on a local machine without GPU.

The repository uses
* Python 3.9
* PyTorch 1.13.1

The repository contains the following files:
* `diffusion-generative-model.ipynb`: From scratch implementation of the 2020 paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Jonathan Ho, Ajay Jain, and Pieter Abbeel for the two moons data set (see below).
